/**
 * AI providers need to call arbitrary third-party HTTP endpoints
 * (OpenRouter, OpenAI-compatible proxies, self-hosted Ollama, internal
 * LLM gateways, etc.). In a browser/webview context the standard
 * `window.fetch` is subject to CORS preflight rules AND — on Android —
 * the platform's cleartext-traffic policy. Neither restriction makes
 * sense for an AI provider call: the user explicitly typed the endpoint
 * URL into our settings and authenticated to it themselves, so we want
 * the same semantics as `curl` or `reqwest` (raw HTTP, no Origin header,
 * no preflight, no cleartext block).
 *
 * `@tauri-apps/plugin-http` gives us exactly that: the request is sent
 * from the Rust side via reqwest, bypassing the renderer entirely. We
 * expose a single helper so every provider goes through the same
 * decision rather than each file re-implementing the platform check.
 *
 * For web builds (no Tauri runtime) we fall back to `window.fetch` and
 * rely on the upstream server to send the right `Access-Control-Allow-*`
 * headers — there is no alternative in that environment.
